==== 7th

ml 
ai
gen ai 
agentic ai 
== 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

sample demo -- you just listen today & practise 

day after tomorrow onward bi

typing -- 10 min 
15mint -- softskills 


	
chatgpt -- build calculator app -- 
geneatvei ai -- geneate the code 
user -- copy the code past in software then app will generate 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc 

agentic ai --- 
smolagents 

generative ai vs agentic ai 

generatie ai generate text, content, code, etc  |
		user or developer copy the code past the build project 
		
agentic ai --> agent write the code, validation , bug fixes every thing is done by agent 

2025-- many company layoff ( fired manager,experince, )
manager - done by chagt, agentic ai frameworsk 

all experience must should learn agentic ai 

ai not kill the job
learners who learn ai they automized the job 

generative ai models are divide into 2 part -->

1- text based model (user enter text -- model generate text) 
2- text to image | text to audio | text to video -- multimodel 

SyntaxError: invalid syntax 
syntax error -- erro which happens from user side or developer 


270000 inr without recording ( nit doesnot provid recording)

very very less for this content 
if you non technical -- please go with recording 


non technical student - please stay in hyder 6month -- complete the leave to y our home

 5 - int value | int datatypes 

b = 5.5
b - variable 
5.5 -- float | float dt 

---
RULES TO DEFINE VARABLE -->
---
1- variable case sensitive 
2- special symbol not allowe in the variable 
3- only _ is allowed 
4- variable doesnot start with digit but variable can end with digit 
5- keywords or reserve words can never be variable

---
syntax -->
---
variable name = value 
value = datatypes 

python important datatypes

	integer
	float
	bool
	string
	complex 
variable - every
function always ends with () 

3function I define hear 

family() -- this family fun with no argument 
family1(d, m) --> family1 2 argument or parameter 
family2(d, m, s, d) -- family 4 argument or parameter 


variable & function 

german_cars(bmw, audi, mer, fer, lambo) 
asina_cars(tata, mahindra, maruthi)


if user or developer want to get more then 1 output -- use print()
if use print only 1 output (not required) 

variable 
function()
functional argument | function parameter 
python operator == + ,- , * 

 
int - value without decimal
float - value with decimal
float only e letter is allowed 
string -- always declare with '' || " " | ''' '''

	 ''' -- we used for multiline comments 
complex -- a + bj 
	a - real part | b - imaginary part | j - squre root of -1 
	
==== 16th 
+91 9154861173 - Mr.Areef  & i will share the qr code at last 
qr code -- course syllbus, recording lecture 

we install software IDE 
	VS CODE 
	ANACONDA -- JUPYTER & SPYDER 
	
I will share the link please instlal & let me know if you have any issue 


python interpreter -- run or excute the code line by line or part of the code 
python compiler -- entire code run at once  
python is both ( interpretter or compiler) both programming language 

ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide user or developer can run the code, write the code, fix the error 

which ide we installed 
	vs code ide 
	jupyter ide 
	spyder ide 
	pycharm ide 

using ide we build ml project, ai project, gen ai project, cicd , mlops, 

Other datatypes to int -- completed 

1- All other datatypes to integer 
float to int -- possible | bool to int - possible | number string to valid but text string to int - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to int | complex to int | user cannot define 2 argument at once

2- All Other datatypes to float 
int to float -- possible | bool to float - possible | number string to float valid but text string to float - invalid 
		type casting we cannot cast or convert text string to float | complex to float | user cannot define 2 argument at once	
	
3- All other datatype to string 
	all other datatype to string | no issue at all 
	
4- All other datatype to Bool
	non zero argument if you define bydefaulat it will detect as true 
	zero argument then it will detect false 
	we can type cast from all other data types to bool 

5- All other dataypes to complex
	complex - only 1 string will be allowed as parameter 
	
== python type casting we are completed today

=== 16th
